- 👋 Hi, I’m @mavisinator30001
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, content creation, and game development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to better create duckyscript payloads.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything, as long as my fellow collaborators are willing to teach me what I don't know. I am a very fast learner.
- 📫 How to reach me: masoncoffey777@gmail.com would be a solid place to start
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I attended the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics in Morganton, NC!
